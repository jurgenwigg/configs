# Configurations backup

I've decided to create a backup of my environment I'm using in daily work. For last few
months I was using mostly VSCode as an IDE. It is a great and very versatile tool but it
has one big flaw - it cannot be used anywhere and it's using a lot of resources while
working on remote servers. That's why I've decided to choose VIM as IDE. 

In this repository I'll keep all my configuration files with simple installation scripts
to create and setup my favorite environment wherever I will working.
